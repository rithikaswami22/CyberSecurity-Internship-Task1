# CyberSecurity Internship - Task 1

This project is for my cybersecurity internship.  

 I used Nmap to scan my local network (192.168.1.0/24) and find open ports and services.  
 Captured network traffic using Wireshark and analyzed the results.  
 Created a report with the findings, common services, and recommendations.  

 This is a part of process to understand how network scans work and how to secure open ports.
